Granting Different Levels of Access in a Django App

The app categorizes users into three groups: Editors, Viewers, and Admins. Each group has specific rights:

Editors: Can create and edit content.
Viewers: Can only see the content.
Admins: Have full access, including creating, editing, and viewing content.
Controlling User Actions

To ensure users only do what they're allowed, the app uses a tool called @permission_required. This tool checks if a user has the necessary permission before letting them do something. For example, if a user is in the "Viewers" group, they won't be able to edit content because they don't have the "can_edit" permission.
